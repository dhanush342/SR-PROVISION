## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Earthy orange (#D2691E) to evoke the natural and authentic quality of Indian groceries, suitable for a local business aesthetic. This decision is based on the desire to convey 'earthiness' and 'authenticity'.
- Background color: Light tan (#F5DEB3), a heavily desaturated version of the primary color, providing a warm and inviting backdrop.
- Accent color: Mustard yellow (#FFDB58), an analogous color, but significantly different in saturation, adding vibrancy and attracting attention to calls-to-action. A modern twist on a classic palette.
- Headline font: 'Belleza' (sans-serif) for a clean and modern appearance well-suited to fashion, art, and design; body font: 'Alegreya' (serif) is for longer text, ensuring readability and a contemporary feel.
- Clean, mobile-first layout with a product-focused design. The layout is optimized for displaying grocery products, ensuring an intuitive user experience without clutter. Modern UX principles guide the design.
- Use simple, intuitive icons to represent product categories and key actions (e.g., language selection, adding to cart). Consistent, modern icon set.
- Incorporate subtle animations for smooth transitions and user feedback (e.g., a gentle highlight on hover, a smooth transition between language options). Micro-interactions enhance the user experience.
